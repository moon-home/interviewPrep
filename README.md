# Machine Learning Engineer Preparation

This is a repo for my learning path to be a machine learning engineer. 

I am particularly interested in 

- ***natual language processing*** and 
- ***quantitative trading***. 

I am also learning the basics as the foundation and backgroud such as: 
- data structure and algorithems (LeetCode, CS61B)
- database (SQL, MongoDB, Firebase)
- system design
- data pipeline (Spark)
- web development (MERN), 
- mobile app development (Flutter)
- Common tools and concepts (Git, Docker, NGINX CI/CD, UT/TDD, GCP certs)
